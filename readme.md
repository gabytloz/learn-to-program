Sandbox - Learn to program
==============

The purpose of this sandbox is to show a compilation of exercises that show the concepts learned in the book ["Learn to Program"](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program), that well, it teaches you to program using Ruby.

Needless to say, this compilation of exercises is based in Chris Pine's material and you can find the original exercises in [his book](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program), which you can find in ["The Pragmatic Programmers" bookshelf] (https://pragprog.com/).

How to use (info for newbie)
------
If for some reason you are new to programing and you ended up here, you'll probably get disappointed. I did some changes to the exercises that make them unfriendly for newbies (adding constants and functions since the first program is a good example) but that still are too stupid for experienced programmers. Still, you are free to check my approach.

These work on the terminal, so what you'll need:

* As stated by the first chapter of the book, you need install ruby in your computer [here's the official documentation on how to do it](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
* Once you install it, you can run the programs. Just open the terminal and write `ruby path_to_the/program.rb`.

That's it, enjoy.
