Sandbox - Learn to program
==============

The purpose of this sandbox is to show a compilation of excercises that show the concepts learned in the book ["Learn to Program"](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program), that well, it teaches you to program using Ruby.

Needless to say, this compilation of excercises is based in Chris Pine's material and you can find the original excercises in his book, ["Learn to Program."](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program) , which you can find in ["The Pragmatic Programmers" bookshelf] (https://pragprog.com/)


How to use (info for newby)
------
If for some reason you are new to programing and you ended up here, you'll probably get dissapointed. I did some changes to the excercises that make them unintuitive for newbys (adding constants and functions since the first program is a good example) but too stupid for experienced programers. Still, you are free to check my approach.

These work on the terminal, so what you'll need:

* As stated by the first chapter of the book, you need nstall ruby in your computer [here's the official documentation on how to do it](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Once you install it, open the terminal and write `ruby path_to_the/program.rb`
